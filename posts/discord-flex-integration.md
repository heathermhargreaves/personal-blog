This blog post was created in collaboration with my team for Twilio's annual Global Solutions Engineering hackathon. The purpose of this hackathon is to surface cutting edge use cases for customers. We landed on the idea of introducing a new channel, Discord, for Flex--Twilio's programmatic call center product. The end goal was to enable Flex agents to chat with customers who reach out to them via Discord. 

Agents receive a sentiment analysis based on the user's text from Discord to understand the user's state before chatting with them. The sentiment was calculated using IBM's Watson Sentiment API, the sentiment was stored in Salesforce, and the user's Salesforce profile was populated in the agent's view.

My specific role was focused on using IBM's Watson sentiment API in a Twilio serverless environment. 

The experience with my teammates was a blast, and we won the hackathon beating out 20+ teams and over 100 participants.
