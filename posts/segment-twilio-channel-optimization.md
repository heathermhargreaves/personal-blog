The idea for this guide came during my time at Twilio after they had acquired Segment. My coworker who I partnered with on this post wanted to tell the story of how Twilio and Segment are better together. This guide shows developers how to use Segment to personalize the communication channels--SMS, Email, or Voice call--for users based on what channel that user interacts with most. This post was originally published on Twilio's blog.
